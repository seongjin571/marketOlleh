Usage: $0 compile [<platforms>] [options] [-- [platform options]]

Description:

  Compiles the one or more specified platform projects into binary applications.
  When no platform is specified, all installed platforms will be compiled.

  Before running the `compile` command, you will want to update the web
  assets in the platform project. This is accomplished by using the `prepare`
  command.

  The convenience command `run` can be used instead of both prepare and compile.

  Multiple platforms can be compiled at once by listing each platform name.

Examples:

  $ $0 compile android
  $ $0 compile android ios
  $ $0 prepare android && $0 compile android

Also see:

  $0 help prepare
  $0 help run
