Usage: $0 prepare [<platforms>] [options]

Description:

  Prepares the one or more specified platform projects using the
  web assets from `www/`. When no platforms are specified, all installed
  platforms will be prepared.

  Once a platform project has been prepared, it is ready to be compiled into
  into a binary application using the `compile` command.

  The convenience command `run` can be used to prepare and compile
  your application. Most users will want to use `run` instead of `prepare`
  and `compile`.

  Multiple platforms can be prepared at once by listing each platform name.
