Usage: $0 local build [<platforms>] [options] [-- [platform options]]

DEPRECATED:

  This command has been deprecated and will soon be removed entirely.

  You should now use the `$0 build <platforms>` command.

  See `$0 build help` to learn more about the command.

Description:


  Builds your application for one or more specific platforms. When no
  platform is specified, then all installed platforms will be built.

  Build executes on the local system. This requires that
  the <platform> SDK environment is correctly installed.

Examples:

  $ $0 local build android
